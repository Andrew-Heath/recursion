// this is what you would do if you liked things to be easy:
// var stringifyJSON = JSON.stringify;

// but you don't so you're going to write it from scratch:

var stringifyJSON = function(obj) {
  // your code goes here
  // discern type of value passed in
  // figure out keys
  // figure out values attached to keys
  // create some order to return the values as
};
